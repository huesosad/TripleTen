Welcome! I'm Luis Jimenez, and this repo showcases my learning journey as a Data Scientist during the TripleTen Bootcamp. Inside, you'll find projects that span from exploratory data analysis (EDA) all the way to building and applying advanced machine learning models

## Welcome to My Data Science Journey!
